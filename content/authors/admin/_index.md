Hello! I'm the founder and lead writer at SammyMail. With over 10 years of experience in email technology, I'm passionate about helping businesses and individuals master email deliverability, authentication, and marketing strategies.

When I'm not writing about email technology, you can find me experimenting with new email tools, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing insights at industry conferences.

Feel free to connect with me on social media or reach out via email. I'm always happy to discuss email technology, share resources, or collaborate on projects.
